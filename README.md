# Prognostic-miRNAs-in-Breast-Cancer-A-Limma-Approach
 This study searched GEO for microarray data comparing breast cancer and normal miRNA profiles. Using the R package Limma, each dataset underwent differential expression analysis. miRBaseonverter ensured version compatibility, finally allowing identification of common differentially expressed miRNAs in breast cancer.
